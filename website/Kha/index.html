																																	                    <p>
																																			                        My name is Kha Le. I'm a Computer Science major at <a href="https://www.wright.edu/">Wright State University</a>. This is my second year at the campus. Java is the only programming language I've learned so far. Currently, I have an opportunity to learn other languages in this class, html, CSS, JavaSCript, and so on.
																																						                </p>
																																								                <p>
																																										                    I first came to the US in 2013, and then moved to Dayton in 2017. I've lived here for about 5 years already and met a lot of friends. We like playing games, especially <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/">League of Legends</a>. We also enjoy many group trips out of state. During weekends, we usually play some sport games such as tennis, volleyball, or kick ball, or either have some drinking parties, which give us the most fun of all time.
